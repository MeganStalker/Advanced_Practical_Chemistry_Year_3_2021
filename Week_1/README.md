# Advanced Chemistry Practical - Computational
## University of Bath, Department of Chemistry
### Week 1

### Part 1

This week will involve testing the programs we need in order to complete the course. 

Before we can start, it is necessary to install the appropriate codes for to perform this exercise. To do this, first open the *Anaconda Prompt* (Start Menu -> Anaconda 3 -> Anaconda Prompt), and type the following (each new line incidates that your should be pressing enter):

```
pip install pylj

pip install polypy

pip install scipy
```

You can now launch the Jupyter notebook from this command line by typing

```
jupyter notebook
```

The first notebook that you should open is that entitled `week_1.ipynb`. 

The notebook will launch in your C drive. This is unfortunate because your C drive will automatically wipe when you log off. So make sure you save the repo elsewhere before you log off. Hopefully BUCS will fix this issue in the coming days.

You should be able to test the programs by following the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook.


### Part 2

Having ensured that the programs we require are correctly installed, we can run a short molecular dynamics simulation. 
Running the simulation involves a combination of following the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook and running commands on your local machine.

**Once you have completed the exercise, please upload the <code>REVCON</code> output file as:**

<code>REVCON_surname_forename</code> to the **"General" Team** in MS Teams.
